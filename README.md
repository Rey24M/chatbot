# ACM Gen AI induction task-1
My attempt at making a simple chatbot using huggingface api and streamlit(for UI) <br>
Supporting files on my system: 
* .env file
* hugging face token
* run command- 
```
streamlit run filename.py
```
Other features I wanted to add but didn't have the time to:
* cleaning up the code a little (It has some unnecessary stuff which when I went to clean up made flagged a whole bunch of errors so nvm)
* clearing the textbox after pressing enter
* a more usefull side bar, summarising coversation topics
* running the model locally without an api token
* counter to improve contest awareness
